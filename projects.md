YWE Ventures

YWE Ventures was established in 2015 as a hybrid human performance, blockchain, & crypto technology fund that makes investments in promising technologies and businesses.

As our portfolio and network grew, so did the vision of YWE Ventures. This led us to raise CC Mutual, a thesis driven fund focused on crypto asset valuation, equity investment,  and algorithmic trading. Regardless of the size of our investments, the size and structure of our fund allows us to continue to support our portfolio companies, investments, and research.

In addition to providing necessary capital, we are committed to leveraging our experience in starting and growing companies, our expertise in health & fitness, crypto-graphic technology, and our network of relationships to help outstanding entrepreneurs, technologies, and funds to cultivate great ideas that will shape the future.
