# Projects: 


# YWE Ventures

*YWE Ventures was established in 2015 as a hybrid technology fund that makes investments in promising technologies and businesses.*

*As our portfolio and network grew, so did the vision of YWE Ventures. This led us to raise CC Mutual, a thesis driven fund focused on crypto asset valuation, equity investment,  and algorithmic trading. Regardless of the size of our investments, the size and structure of our fund allows us to continue to support our portfolio companies, investments, and research.*
