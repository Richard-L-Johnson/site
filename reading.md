#Reading, Read, Recommendations

This is a view of what I am currently reading, what I have read in the past, and top recommendations. 

#Reading

[Three Body Problem](https://amzn.to/2Y9ws5A) 

to get you started. It's not meant to be a perfectly complete blog theme but rather a starting point if you want to 
experiment with static website generators and [build your own template](https://ines.io/blog/the-ultimate-guide-static-websites-jekyll).

#Read
[The Lessons of History](https://amzn.to/2H9j8bu) 

#Top Recommendations
[The Prince](https://amzn.to/2Y9ws5A) 

*This list is compiled from a lifetime of reading.*
