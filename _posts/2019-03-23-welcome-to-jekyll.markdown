# Three Tenets To Life. <br>

Health, Wealth, and Wisdom. These three tenets have been discussed throughout history by Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, and Benjamin Franklin, just to name a few. Many of these men have suggested applying a first principles approach when making decisions throughout ones life. One should consider the material cause (what is it composed of), the formal cause (the arranangement of the matter), the efficeint cause (the agent or primary source), and the final cause of things (telos, purpose). 

I am a believer in this as well, that is why clearly defining the objective is a splendid place to start. But how do we take the metaphysical and apply it pragmatically to our daily lives?

Health: Strength and vitality — the ability to move fluidly through daily life and have the energy to complete all tasks. Strength is health.

Wealth: Freedom to pursue things of interest and wonder without the fear of poverty or ridicule. This is easiest when you realize you need but very little to thrive and survive.

Wisdom: Intellectual freedom. To possess both open mindedness and rationality that can be applied throughout ones life.
Once you identify specific-personalized meanings of not only these words but countless others you will be able to create principles to guide you throughout life. Principles you create promote rational decision making and the flexibility needed to thrive in this ever changing world, where the only thing we can count on is a constant state of flux.
