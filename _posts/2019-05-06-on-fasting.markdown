# On Fasting <br>

  Through the writings and mental models developed by the likes of Benjamin Franklin, Charlie Munger, and Daniel Kahneman 
I would like to posit on the principles of fasting. I will approach this thesis with a multidisciplinary approach to answer 
the question of “why would one fast?”

  Let’s first look at four major disciplines that are applicable to the matter of fasting. Biology, Economics, Psychology, and 
History. I will attempt to elucidate how each discipline relates to the topic of fasting. Through a multi-disciplinary 
approach, I hope that the costs and benefits of fasting are readily apparent.

   To most readers it is easy to understand that biology is a vital part of fasting, however the other major disciplines listed 
may seem abstract to the practice of fasting. In its most base form, fasting is going without food and certain liquids for an 
extended period of time. The time applied to a fast varies from, as short as in between meals, to weeks at a time. Some of 
the most common fasts are for 24 hrs. and go for up to 7 days. The time chosen to fast is dependent upon the person performing 
the fast. You may say to yourself “I can fast! I will forgo food for 5 days.” If this is the mindset you possess, let me 
provide an analogy to exercise, if you have not been regularly exercising it is unreasonable for you to get started with a 
marathon, not to say people can’t do a 7 day fast or a marathon with no preparation, but it will not be an enjoyable experience. Success will be more easily attained through a gradual buildup of time fasted.
A definition of terms is warranted before we get into things in further depth. Terms related to fasting protocols seem to 
change fluidly throughout time, much of this is due to cultural mores and trends, which I will cover later. I will be using 
the word fast to mean the simple restriction of food and all liquids, time restricted eating to mean eating only within a 
specified window, intermittent fasting to mean a fast lasting 8–12 hours, and a water only fast. There are many other ways 
to fast, but those are numerous and outside the scope of this thesis.

A logical question of why are fasting practices present throughout so many cultures and religions and why is it something 
that is no longer adhered to in such a strict manner? To answer this second question, I will call on the disciplines listed 
above, as I feel a multidisciplinary approach will make thing seem more transparent. I will do this in a list that covers 
core concepts in biology, chemistry, economics, psychology, and history. Once finished I will attempt to show how approaching
a simple subject like fasting with a multidisciplinary approach will allow you 1) to understand the mechanisms involved 
2) show overlaps in the disciplines that can be leveraged for better adherence 3) to better construct a fasting protocol 
suited for you.

# Biology: Hormesis, Autophagy, Encoded DNA

  In regard to biology I would like to initially address the principle of hormesis. Plainly speaking hormesis is the body’s 
ability to endure short intense bouts of pain or restriction for longer term endurance or defense. A flu vaccination is an 
example of your body using hormesis to fend off future illness, by injecting a small amount of the flu virus your body builds 
up immunity to future inflictions. Hormesis applies to fasting much the same way as the previous example, by following a 
fasting protocol, a mandated restriction from sustenance, your body will come begin to build up the strength to go for 
prolonged periods of time without the need to eat or drink. To some this may seem like a super power, as now it is estimated 
that the average American eats between 12 and 15 times a day (includes snacking). 

  I would also like to state the principle of 
antifragility as it is closely related to hormesis. Nassim Taleb describes antifragility as the ability to come back from a 
shock stronger than before, Friedrich Nietzsche also writes about this concept, most notable with the line “that which does not
kill you, makes you stronger.”Now to autophagy, the little-known benefit of fasting that is becoming widely talked about in 
cancer treatment circles. Autophagy is when cells eat themselves, beneficial when the cells that are eating themselves are 
cancerous.You might ask why this is beneficial to someone that is not diagnosed with cancer, autophagy is beneficial because almost 
everyone living has cancerous cells in their body and following a fasting protocol may inhibit the metastasis of the cells. 
Autophagy, to the point it has been researched seems to be an easy way to combat cancer and its debilitating effects.

  Next, we look at encoded DNA and how the genes passed down through generations is hard coded into your biological framework. 
These genes can be influenced by many things, also including epigenetically through your environment. It is the battle of what 
you are born with and what you are exposed to. Many genes will lay dormant if not activated by epigenetic factors, other genes 
will be active while in utero. Say for instance your great grandparents experienced a drought or famine and had to endure 
prolonged periods of restricted eating or fasting, these experiences become encoded into the DNA that is passed down and makes 
you more susceptible to the effects of fasting. Epigenetics influences your genetics through environmental triggers such as 
stress, food, and air quality to name a few. Thus, the things you choose to do for work, eat, and the air you breath all have 
an impact on your overall health and could either aid or hinder your ability to successfully fast. If you are unhappy with 
your job, eating poorly, and living in a poor air quality environment it will be much harder for you to start, adhere to, 
and maintain a fasting regimen.

# Economics: Game Theory, Opportunity Costs, Incentives

  When applying game theory to fasting one needs to be aware of the factors within the game, mainly actors, rules, and 
competitors. Eating or not eating is not a one play game, it is an infinite game you play throughout your life. What you 
choose to eat or not eat has an impact on your next meal, your health, your sleep, your mood, your relationships, and your 
success. Knowing that there is so much at stake one realizes why there are other forces trying to persuade you to over eat 
and avoid fasting. If a large percentage of the population decided to forgo meals on a consistent basis GDP would take a hit.
Modern economies are built on consumption. Hence the pervasive use of targeted ads and influencers used to get people to eat 
more at each meal and to eat more often. There are certain rules or customs at play, many people feel trapped by the rituals 
of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Many view meal times as a chance to take a break, catch up on emails, and meet with others. 
No one wants to be classified as an outsider or lose out on opportunities due to skipping meals. However, it is a super power 
to be able to go prolonged periods of time without eating or thinking about eating for that matter. Many fasting practitioners 
laud the productivity benefits of not preparing or worrying about meals.

  When one over eats the opportunity costs manifest in the amount of time and money lost on buying food, preparing food, and eating food in the short term. Long term opportunity costs are present in negative health outcomes, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s.
Incentives are the key to any habit. The current incentives related to eating are skewed in the direction of over consumption. 
Food is now readily accessible and often times cheap. There is also engineering to make food more addictive and palatable. 
Bear these in mind when considering what to eat, when to eat, and how much to eat. Ask the questions of why are things 
structured this way? Who wins, who loses? What are the long-term impacts on my health and longevity?

# Psychology: Operant Conditioning, Pavlovian Responses, Social Proof

  The psychological component involved in fasting, or any habit formation, is both the most important aspect and the least 
understood. Operant conditioning is an act followed by a consequence that will then influence the performance of the act in 
the future. When applying the principle of operant conditioning to fasting, you must realize that there will be little to no 
immediate positive effects. Fasting, for most, does not provide instant feedback like in the case of a coin flip where it is 
immediately apparent if you guessed heads or tails accurately. This is one of the most difficult aspects of any 
self-discipline one chooses to pursue. Instant gratification is just that instant, while most self-restraining activities 
are not enjoyable, and their benefits are not readily evident.

  Pavlovian conditional responses are the reptilian brained responses that are automatic. They happen unbeknownst to you at 
the subconscious level. Things such as reproduction, breathing, fight or flight responses, and hunger, are for the most 
part tracked and controlled by your reptilian brain. Knowing this it is easy to understand that fasting in modern times 
may cause a lot of sirens to go off. Unlike our ancestor’s, who fasted out of necessity due to drought or food shortages, 
food, safety, and shelter are overly available in modern times. Fasts are now optional, where as in previous generations 
they were conducted without choice and inability to sustain a fast and stay productive meant you did not survive.

  Next, let’s look to social proof and its role in fasting. Social proof is a termed penned by Robert Cialdini. 
Social proof is a social phenomenon wherein people mimic the actions and decisions of others to undertake behavior in given 
situations. Think of social proof as because John is doing fasting I will too. It is a signal that the behavior is warranted 
because a peer or idol is behaving in such a way.

# History: Culture, Religion, and Trends

  Fasting has been a part of life for our species from the days of the savannah to modernity. Fasting has gone by many 
names and has been practiced in various fashions throughout time. Many readers may have first been exposed to fasting 
through religious rituals, in fact, fasting is a staple in most of the dominant religions. Jewish culture fasts for certain 
holidays, Mormons fast one Sunday a month, Muslims fast sun up to sun down for Ramadan, and Buddhists fast on full moon and 
other observable Buddhist holidays, even Pagans fast on seasonal equinoxes.

  Our current zeitgeist does not regard fasting as an essential part of culture or survival. People may still be religious but 
not follow the customs as closely as previous generations. Earlier generations would fast because that’s what their parents 
did and so forth, where no many may not follow the same rituals because they find it uncomfortable to feel hungry for a 
period of time. This is not entirely their fault, current incentives, media, and trends work actively against fasting and 
abstaining from over eating. 

  Advertising is now staffed with some of the smartest people and algorithms the world has ever 
seen. They work in tandem to get people to consume more. We have been conditioned to give into our desires and to consume ad 
infinitum.

  It is now more important than ever to begin creating a culture in which fasting is encouraged and applauded. Encouragement of 
over indulgence has led our culture astray. If strategic cultural morae’s can be cultivated now it may lead our species down 
a divergent and healthier path than most of us are currently on. It starts with committing yourself to establishing the 
habit, creating personal skin in the game, and holding yourself accountable to not failing. Write it down, tell a friend, 
put some money on the line, and avoid anyone and anything that may get in your way to establishing the habit of fasting.

“Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with 
coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: ‘Is this the condition that I feared?’ … It is precisely in 
times of immunity from care that the soul should toughen itself beforehand for occasions of greater stress, and it is 
while Fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against her violence.” - Seneca
